  /// a [StateError] if it's already been completed. This is particularly helpful in cleanup
  /// scenarios or when dealing with multiple potential completion points.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final completer = Completer<String>();
  /// // This will complete the completer
  /// completer.completeIfNotComplete('first');
  /// // This will be ignored since the completer is already complete
  /// completer.completeIfNotComplete('second');
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [value] Optional value to complete the [Completer] with. If not provided,
  ///   completes with null for nullable types.
